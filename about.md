### About us
We are a group of scientists working at the intersection of neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and causality. Our lab has become a leading voice in critically examining how causality works in complex systems where randomization isn't possible—a fundamental challenge in both neuroscience and AI. We're particularly focused on the credit assignment problem: understanding how brains and AI systems determine which components are responsible for success or failure. Our approach views deep learning through the lens of cultural evolution, arguing that "nothing makes sense in deep learning, except in the light of evolution."

### Research
Our current work centers on three interconnected themes: causality in data science, the evolution of intelligence (both biological and artificial), and democratizing scientific education. We're pursuing ambitious projects including simulating the complete C. elegans nervous system—an effort to reverse-engineer an entire organism's neural computation. This connects to our broader NeuroAI agenda, where we explore how insights from neuroscience can improve AI and vice versa.

The lab has pioneered several major initiatives that have transformed the scientific landscape. Neuromatch, co-founded by Konrad, has trained thousands of students globally in computational neuroscience through free, accessible online programs. The Community for Rigor (C4R), launched in 2023 with NIH support, provides open-source educational modules addressing research biases, logical fallacies around causality, and experimental design—essential skills often missing from traditional scientific training.

Recent projects span from developing methods for causal inference in high-dimensional neural data to exploring how evolution shapes both biological and artificial neural networks. We've shown that cultural evolution provides a powerful framework for understanding why certain deep learning architectures succeed while others fail. Our work increasingly focuses on credit assignment—both how brains solve this fundamental learning problem and how we can better assign credit in real-world causal systems.

The best way to get a sense of what's currently going on in the lab is to check out the work of individual lab members:

### Lab Members

Our research group is remarkably interdisciplinary. Our interests span statistics, physics, biology, applied mathematics, molecular biology, metascience, cognitive science, and many other disciplines. Visit our [people page](http://kordinglab.com/people/) to see more information on each person who works in the lab (publications, contact information, photos).

### Lab Culture

Our lab is a wonderful spot for anyone who is super driven by curiosity and likes to learn/move through ideas quickly. Instead of one big "lab project", everyone is generally the chief of their own individual projects.

Since our lab includes several fields, we don't have big lab meetings with everyone. Instead, we engage in a number of practices to facilitate good communication in the lab. Currently these include
0. Weekly 'lab teachings' where someone teaches a thing. http://kordinglab.com/2018/08/29/upcoming-lab-teaching.html
0. 'One-on-ones'. Every semester everyone in the lab is expected to sit down with everyone else for an hour.
0. Lab tea time. It's tea! And science. A 10-minute talk by someone about anything, including their current work.
0. Coding overviews. Structured like the one-on-ones
0. A lab hammock, hangboard, and art on loan from the Penn Museum
0. Monday morning donuts @ 9:00am

Every week, more or less, we chat about current lab practices and sometimes vote on new things.
