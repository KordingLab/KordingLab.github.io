## Community for Rigor

The [Community for Rigor (C4R)](https://c4r.io) is an initiative founded by Konrad Kording that operates as an integral part of our lab's mission to improve scientific practices across the research community.

### What is C4R?

C4R is a user-friendly, open-source educational platform launched in 2023 with support from the National Institutes of Health. The platform addresses critical challenges in research methodology through interactive modules and community engagement.

### Core Educational Modules

C4R provides training in essential areas of research rigor:

- **Biases in Research** - Identifying and mitigating cognitive biases, selection bias, confirmation bias, and other systematic errors that can affect research outcomes
- **Causal Inference** - Understanding the difference between correlation and causation, and learning proper techniques for establishing causal relationships
- **Hypothesis Development** - Crafting clear, testable hypotheses and understanding the role of pre-registration in research
- **Literature Search Design** - Systematic approaches to reviewing existing work and avoiding cherry-picking
- **Experimental Variables** - Proper identification and control of independent, dependent, and confounding variables
- **Statistical Fallacies** - Recognizing and avoiding common statistical mistakes, p-hacking, and misinterpretation of results

### Why C4R Matters

The reproducibility crisis in science has highlighted the need for better training in research methods. Many researchers receive limited formal education in these critical areas. C4R fills this gap by providing:

- **Accessible Education** - Free, online modules that can be completed at your own pace
- **Practical Applications** - Real-world examples from neuroscience, psychology, biology, and other fields
- **Community Support** - A growing community of researchers committed to improving scientific practices
- **Evidence-Based Content** - All materials are grounded in research on research methodology

### Lab Integration

C4R principles are deeply integrated into the Kording Lab's research practices:

- All new lab members complete core C4R modules during onboarding
- Lab meetings regularly discuss C4R topics and case studies
- Research projects incorporate C4R checklists for experimental design
- Lab members contribute to developing new C4R content
- We beta-test new modules and provide feedback

### Get Involved

#### For Lab Members:
1. Complete the core modules at [c4r.io](https://c4r.io)
2. Apply C4R principles in your research design
3. Consider contributing content based on your expertise
4. Share C4R resources with collaborators

#### For the Broader Community:
- **Educators**: Integrate C4R modules into your courses
- **Researchers**: Use C4R tools to improve your research practices
- **Institutions**: Adopt C4R as part of research training programs
- **Contributors**: Help develop new content and translations

### Impact and Recognition

Since its launch, C4R has:
- Trained thousands of researchers worldwide
- Been adopted by multiple universities for graduate training
- Received endorsements from leading scientists and institutions
- Contributed to improving research practices across disciplines

### Our Commitment

Through C4R, the Kording Lab demonstrates its commitment not just to conducting rigorous research, but to actively improving how science is done globally. We believe that better science starts with better scientific thinking, and C4R is our contribution to making that vision a reality.

*"Science is hard enough without making avoidable mistakes. C4R helps researchers identify and avoid the pitfalls that compromise scientific integrity."* - Konrad Kording
