**Attending conferences**

As the lab has been growing in size it seems useful to describe the standard conference policies.

  > 1. **Attending conferences is an important career investment.** Lab members are highly encouraged to attend 1-2 conferences a year. Significantly more gets to be a drain on time and resources. Significantly less jeopardizes networking which is crucial for academic success.
  > 2. **Conferences are most useful when presenting there.** As such, unless there are exceptional circumstances, lab members are expected to present at conferences that they attend.
  > 3. **Conferences are a way of getting feedback on a project.** As such, each project should be presented by one person (generally the lead author) at one conference. If a lot of progress has been made since the last conference then the new version of a project can be presented at a new conference. Still by and large there should be a one project, one person, one presentation correspondance.
  > 4. **Conferences are a way of socializing with other people/labs/ideas.** As such, lab members should not socialize with one another at conferences.
  > 5. Please discuss any exceptions you require.
