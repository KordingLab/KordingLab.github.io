# Upcoming lab teachings

Every Friday at 2pm, we get together (over pizza, sometimes) for lab teachings.
On a rotating basis, each member of the lab speaks and teaches about something they know.
Anything, really. Relevant and interesting topics, good skills to know, nice Python packages,
neuroscientific princples, new findings and literature reviews... whatever!

Get on the listserv for announcements: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kording-lab-teachings

### Call for topics

Please list below, topics you would like to learn more about (you may share your name or not, up to you):

* cloud computing
* current state of deep reinforcement learning, control, robotics, and all that
