## Join the Kording Lab

We are always looking for talented and passionate individuals who want to push the boundaries of neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and causality research. Our lab thrives on interdisciplinary collaboration and bold thinking.

### Current Openings

We welcome applications from exceptional candidates at all levels. While specific funded positions vary, we are particularly interested in hearing from candidates with:

- **Strong computational/mathematical background** - Experience in machine learning, statistics, physics, or applied mathematics
- **Neuroscience expertise** - Understanding of neural systems, from molecular to behavioral levels
- **Interdisciplinary mindset** - Ability to bridge AI, neuroscience, and causality
- **Scientific rigor** - Commitment to reproducible, transparent research practices

### Graduate Students

**PhD Programs:** Prospective graduate students should apply through one of Penn's graduate programs:
- [Neuroscience Graduate Group (NGG)](https://www.med.upenn.edu/ngg/)
- [Bioengineering](https://be.seas.upenn.edu/doctoral/)
- [Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/graduate/program-offerings/phd/)
- [Applied Mathematics and Computational Science](https://www.amcs.upenn.edu/)

**What we offer:**
- Training at the intersection of AI and neuroscience
- Access to cutting-edge computational resources
- Collaboration with world-leading researchers
- Participation in initiatives like Neuromatch and C4R
- Mentorship focused on both research excellence and career development

**Rotation Students:** We regularly accept rotation students from NGG, Bioengineering, and other programs. Contact Konrad directly to discuss rotation projects.

### Postdoctoral Fellows

We seek postdocs who can drive independent research while contributing to our collaborative environment. Ideal candidates will have:
- PhD in neuroscience, computer science, physics, mathematics, or related field
- Strong publication record demonstrating innovative thinking
- Computational skills (Python/MATLAB/R, machine learning, data analysis)
- Interest in causality, credit assignment, or AI-neuroscience interfaces

**Funding opportunities:**
- Lab-funded positions (when available)
- Support for fellowship applications (NIH F32, NSF, HFSP, etc.)
- [Penn Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://postdocs.upenn.edu/penn-postdoctoral-opportunities)

### Research Staff

We occasionally have openings for:
- **Research Scientists** - Lead technical projects and mentor students
- **Data Scientists** - Develop analysis pipelines and computational tools
- **Research Coordinators** - Manage projects and lab operations

### Visiting Scholars

We welcome visiting students and scholars who can contribute to ongoing projects. Visits typically range from 3-12 months. Visitors should:
- Have their own funding or apply for visitor fellowships
- Propose a specific project aligned with lab interests
- Bring complementary expertise that enriches the lab

### How to Apply

**For all positions:**

1. **Email Konrad directly** at kording@upenn.edu with:
   - CV including publications and presentations
   - Brief statement (1-2 pages) describing:
     - Your research interests and background
     - Why you want to join the Kording Lab specifically
     - Your career goals
   - Names and contact information for 2-3 references
   - For postdocs: 1-2 representative publications

2. **Subject line format:** "[Position Type] Application - [Your Name]"

3. **Timeline:** We review applications on a rolling basis. For graduate students, follow program-specific deadlines.

### What Makes a Strong Candidate

Beyond technical skills, we value:
- **Intellectual curiosity** - Willingness to explore unconventional ideas
- **Collaborative spirit** - Ability to work in interdisciplinary teams
- **Open science commitment** - Enthusiasm for sharing code, data, and knowledge
- **Growth mindset** - Eagerness to learn new methods and fields
- **Communication skills** - Ability to explain complex ideas clearly

### Life in the Lab

**Culture:**
- Collaborative, not competitive atmosphere
- Regular lab meetings, journal clubs, and social events
- Strong emphasis on work-life balance
- Commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion

**Location:**
- Based at University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia
- Part of vibrant neuroscience and AI communities
- Lab members expected in office 4 days/week (see [Internal](/internal) page for members)

**Resources:**
- Access to high-performance computing clusters
- Funding for conferences and training
- Connections to industry and clinical partners
- Part of Penn's world-class research ecosystem

### Diversity Statement

The Kording Lab is committed to building a diverse and inclusive research environment. We strongly encourage applications from individuals of all backgrounds, particularly those from groups historically underrepresented in computational neuroscience and AI. We believe diverse perspectives strengthen science and actively work to create an environment where everyone can thrive.
