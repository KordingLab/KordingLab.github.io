[Konrad Kording](http://koerding.com/) runs the Kording lab at the University of Pennsylvania.
Konrad is trying to foster an environment of creativity in which important problems get
solved in interesting ways and unimportant problems get solved in fun ways.
Konrad believes in the role of playful approaches towards science.
He also believes that ultimately we need to solve important medical problems.
His lab focuses on Big Data approaches to neuroscience. Massive amounts of data
exist in neuroscience and work in the lab is focused on making sense out of such datasets (and obtaining such sets).
