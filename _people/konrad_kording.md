[Konrad Kording](http://koerding.com/) runs his lab at the University of Pennsylvania.
Konrad is interested in the question of how the brain solves the credit assignment problem and
similarly how we should assign credit in the real world (through causality). In extension
of this main thrust he is interested in applications of causality in biomedical research.

As Co-Director of the [CIFAR Learning in Machines & Brains Program](https://cifar.ca/research-programs/learning-in-machines-brains/), 
Konrad oversees the collective intellectual development of this prestigious program which includes over 30 Fellows, 
Advisors, and Global Scholars working to understand the computational and mathematical principles behind learning 
in both biological and artificial systems. The program brings together international scientists to examine how 
artificial neural networks could be inspired by the human brain and to advance the field of deep learning.

Konrad has trained as student at ETH Zurich with Peter Konig, as postdoc at UCL London with Daniel
Wolpert and at MIT with Josh Tenenbaum. After a decade at Northwestern University he is now
PIK professor at UPenn.
