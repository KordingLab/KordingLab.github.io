Konrad Kording is redefining the boundaries between neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and causal inference. As Penn Integrates Knowledge (PIK) Professor, he leads pioneering research on how brains and AI systems solve the credit assignment problem—determining what actions led to success or failure. His radical perspective that deep learning only makes sense through evolutionary thinking has influenced how the field approaches AI development. Trained with pioneers Peter König (ETH), Daniel Wolpert (UCL), and Josh Tenenbaum (MIT), Konrad brings unique insights from motor control, Bayesian cognition, and computational neuroscience. His impact multiplies through initiatives he co-founded: Neuromatch has trained 10,000+ students globally in computational neuroscience, while C4R is transforming how scientists approach causality and rigor. After building a world-renowned lab at Northwestern, he now shapes the future of intelligence research at Penn.

As Co-Director of the [CIFAR Learning in Machines & Brains Program](https://cifar.ca/research-programs/learning-in-machines-brains/), 
Konrad oversees the collective intellectual development of this prestigious program which includes over 30 Fellows, 
Advisors, and Global Scholars working to understand the computational and mathematical principles behind learning 
in both biological and artificial systems. The program brings together international scientists to examine how 
artificial neural networks could be inspired by the human brain and to advance the field of deep learning.
