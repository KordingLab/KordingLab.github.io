### Bio

Ilenna graduated from Dartmouth College in 2015, majoring in Neuroscience and specializing in cellular and molecular Neuroscience. She worked as a technician on epigenetic psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University for 2 years and then started her PhD in Neuroscience at UPenn in 2017. Leaning into her longtime latent interest, she jumped into Computational Neuroscience and started working in Konrad Kording's lab in 2018. She loves stories, music, dancing, biking, and having good conversations over tasty food.

### Research Interests

What can we learn by building models of the brain? 

Building dendritically detailed neurons using deep neural networks.

Thinking about dendritic computation in terms of both role and capacity.
